## Overview

This application allows a user to play a game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' against the computer, which makes a random selection at gameplay. The user can make their choice simply by clicking on their selection. A 'difficult' variation is also available for a user to select, which provides additional fighter choices. The result of the game is displayed in the next view once the user makes a selection. The browser will audibly let the user know the results of the game. The side panels display the total accumulated wins for both players and persists across refreshes. 

## Setup
  
- Clone this repository down to your local machine

## Challenges & Wins  
This project really helped solidify my understanding of truly separating the DOM and the Data Model. I definately should have incorporated more developer empathy toward the beginning of the project, which would have greatly reduced the amount of time spent refactoring. I greatly appreciate the assistance from my instructors, mentor and classmates.
